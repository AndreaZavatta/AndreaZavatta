### Hi there 👋
### I don't know how to code, I am new here. I want to make friends even though i am the worst CSS coder and weakest Maraffone player 😭
## I copy my code from [Marco Antolini](https://github.com/MarcoAntolini) repositories because he is the best coder i have ever knew 😍

### I am an undergraduate student. 
Believer in agile software development, open-source, team work and Clean Code.
Always wanting to improve.
